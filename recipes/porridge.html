        <p>Kiki's Delivery Service follows thirteen year old Kiki who moves with her cat Jiji to an ocean town where she heard she could spend a year alone as a witch in training! After she learns to get control of her broomstick, she sets up a courier service for the town and is soon known by many. She struggles with insecurities when she doubts her own magic abilities and she must overcome these worries to get her witch powers back!</p>
        <p>After delivering a note in the rain (not a smart move, Kiki), Kiki comes down with a cold. Osono, a motherly figure to Kiki, makes her a bowl of Okayu or rice porridge.</p>
