        <p>Another comforting snack from Spirited Away are those ever-so-squishy red bean buns.</p> 
        <p>While making these from scratch can be a bit laborious, the end result is worth it when you get to hold your own squishy creations in your hands.</p>

        <strong>Ingredients for Red Bean Paste:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup red beans</li>
            <li>3 cups water</li>
            <li>3/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1 tbsp vanilla extract </li>
        </ul>
        <strong>Ingredients for Dough:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>4 cups flour</li>
            <li>2 cups lukewarm water</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon instant yeast</li>
        </ul>

        <strong>Steps for Red Bean Paste:</strong>
        <ol>
            <li>In the bowl of an Instant pot (or similar pressure cooker), wash the beans twice.</li>
            <li>Add the water and cook on the program "Beans" for 60 minutes. Make sure the nob on your Instant Pot is pointed towards sealing.</li>
            <li>Once done cooking, remove the lid and add the sugar and vanilla extract.</li>
            <li>Turn the Instant Pot to saut√© to cook all the water out. Cook until a paste forms and allow the red bean paste to cool before wrapping the buns.</li>
        </ol>
        <strong>Steps for Dough:</strong>
        <ol>
            <li>In the bowl of an electric mixer (or just a large bowl), combine all the ingredients.</li>
            <li>Knead on medium for 10 minutes or until a firm slightly elastic dough forms. This dough cannot be sticky or tacky at all. It's better to have a firmer dough than wet. Add flour as needed.</li>
            <li>Cover the bowl with a damp cloth and allow to rise for 1 hour or until doubled in size.</li>
            <li>Dump dough out onto a floured surface and cut into equal pieces (whatever size you want).</li>
            <li>To wrap the buns, flat the dough into a circular disc. Try to make the edges slightly thinner than the center.</li>
            <li>Place 1 spoonful of red bean paste into the center. Start to pull the dough up while pushing the filling down with your finger. Crimp the edges all around.</li>
            <li>Allow to rest again under a damp towel for 10-20 minutes while your water comes to a boil in your steamer.</li>
            <li>Line the steamer with parchment paper and drape a damp cloth over it. Place buns in with about a centimeter of space around each. Steam for 12 minutes.</li>
            <li>Turn off the heat and let sit for 1-2 minutes, then remove the lid. Otherwise you risk collapsing the steamed bun with the sudden change in temperature.</li>
        </ol>
